            <div class="fs-6">I'm a full stack developer in training. I spend my days battling bugs in
              code and my nights being gently assaulted by my overly enthusiastic dog—who thinks my leg is a chew toy.

              When I'm not getting nibbled on, I’m out enjoying the great outdoors, attempting to convince squirrels to
              code for me. Tech and nature are my jam, even if my dog believes every hiking trail is a potential chew
              zone.

              Join me as I navigate the wild world of programming and puppy parenting, where every day is an
              adventure—and a potential trip to the vet!</div>

            <div class="fs-6">Kevin is a full-stack developer by trade, but in his heart, he's a certified tech wizard,
              blending code like a master chef mixes spices. When he's not turning coffee into code, he's probably
              debugging his life choices or trying to convince his plants that CSS can make them grow.
              <br /><br />
              Specialties include:
              <br />
              <span style="margin-left: 20px">HTML - Because everything needs a good foundation, just like his daily
                stack of pancakes.</span> <br />
              <span style="margin-left: 20px">CSS - Making the web pretty, one pixel at a time. He believes in beauty,
                even if it's just in the
                backend.</span><br />
              <span style="margin-left: 20px">JavaScript - His love language, though he's still trying to understand its
                dark, asynchronous
                secrets.</span><br /><br />

              Kevin spends his free time teaching his dog how to fetch data instead of just sticks, and arguing with
              his
              smart home devices about who's really in charge.
